# Multi-objective Evolutionary Clustering of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data
In this study a multi-objective evolutionary clustering algorithm for scRNA-seq data is designed, implemnted, and tested. <br>

Systematic comparison and evaluation with baseline clustering algorithms (Kmeans and PhenoGraph) and single-objective evolutionary algorithm were performed using a high-performance computing resource.<br>
