House-16H dataset

1: Description.

This database was designed on the basis of data provided by US Census Bureau [http://www.census.gov]. The data were collected as part of the 1990 US census. These are mostly counts cumulated at different survey levels. For the purpose of this data set a level State-Place was used. Data from all states was obtained. Most of the counts were changed into appropriate proportions. 

These are all concerned with predicting the median price of the house in the region based on demographic composition and a state of housing market in the region. A number in the name signifies the number of attributes of the data set. A following letter denotes a very rough approximation to the difficulty of the task. For Low task difficulty, more correlated attributes were chosen as signified by univariate smooth fit of that input on the target. Tasks with High difficulty have had their attributes chosen to make the modelling more difficult due to higher variance or lower correlation of the inputs to the target.
